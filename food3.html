   <h3>Descripton</h3>
<p>
    <em>
        Once I started smoking my ham like I’m going to show you in this recipe, I have literally never bought one of those spiral cut hams with the sauce packet again. Smoked pulled ham might ruin all other ham for you. This is not a spiral cut ham (make sure to read my ingredient notes, below). When you smoke and roast your ham low and slow, it takes it from tough and chewy to absolutely fall-off-the-bone soft. It shreds like pulled pork, and with my flavor rub and glaze, combined with the smoke, it’s packed with incredible flavor. If you don’t have a smoker, you can still make pulled ham in the oven as well! I’ve included oven instructions in the recipe card below.

<h3>Instructions</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Score and rub: After rinsing your ham with cool water to remove extra salty residue from the juices it’s packed in, you’ll pat dry and score your ham. This is simply using a sharp knife to score a diamond pattern on all sides, about 1/4″ deep. This allows the smoke and flavors to penetrate better into the meat. This step is hard to see in the beginning photos, but you’ll notice the scoring pattern when you look at the ham photos post-smoking. You’ll then rub the whole ham down with a thin layer of mustard.</li>
    <li>Seasoning Mix: The next step is to combine a mix of spices and seasonings. You’ll notice there’s zero salt in my rub. That’s because cured hams are often already packed with some salt and adding more might overdo it.</li>
    <li>Sprinkle all over: Cover the ham with the seasoning rub. As the mustard starts to absorb the spices, it will start to look wet all over.</li>
    <li>Smoke: Place in a 225° smoker. I don’t recommend increasing the smoke temperature because it risks your sugar burning. I like to use apple wood, but feel free to use your favorite. The ham needs to reach an internal temperature of between 155-165 degrees during this step, which for me takes about 6 hours for a 9-ish lb ham shank, but timing will vary due to size of your ham and other factors. Yours may take more or less.</li>
    <li>Spritz: I spray my ham with apple juice every 2-3 hours to keep the outside moist and avoid any burning of the spice rub. Again, you can spritz with any of the alternate liquids mentioned. Depending on the timing here, you may only spritz one time. (While your ham is smoking, you’ll mix your glaze so that is ready).</li>
    <li>Pour remaining butter from hot pan (be careful, the handle is hot) and also the meat juices from the foil, over the sliced meat. Notes</li>
