   <h3>Descripton</h3>
<p>
    <em>
        Tri tip is one of my very favorite cuts of beef. It’s perfectly sized for a family dinner, and not overwhelming to cook in both size and effort. it only needs minimal seasoning and a couple hours on the smoker- and there’s no complicated steps like spritzing with liquid or brushing with sauce. Simply leave it on for a couple hours and then give it a quick sear and it’s the most perfect no-fuss summer meal that’s sure to impress! Keep reading for instructions on how to make the perfect smoked tri tip roast.

<h3>Ingredients</h3>    
<ul>
    <li>1-2 lb tri tip roast</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon oil</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons steak seasoning (or simply kosher salt and pepper)</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>

</ul>
<h3>Instructions</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat smoker to 225°. Place tri tip roast on a cutting board, or a tray covered in foil.  Drizzle a little oil over the roast (about 2-3 teaspoons) and rub to coat all sides.  Drizzle 2-3 teaspoons oil over your roast and rub on all sides.</li>
    <li>Sprinkle steak seasoning (or kosher salt and pepper) on all surfaces of roast, turning to cover ends and sides as well.  </li>
    <li>Place roast on smoker and close lid.  Cook until internal temperature on the thickest part of meat registers between 130-135 for best results (medium rare).  This is generally about 30 minutes per pound, but make sure to use a digital thermometer where you can constantly monitor your temperature without opening the smoker too much!</li>
    <li>When roast is getting close to being done, heat a cast iron (or other heavy-bottomed pan) to high heat.  This can be done on a bbq grill or indoors. </li>
    <li>When roast comes to temperature, remove from smoker.  Place about 2 tablespoons butter in the hot cast iron pan to melt.  Place the roast in the pan and let sear for a minute or two, until a golden caramelized crust forms. (Though I prefer this skillet/butter method, you could also simply give your roast a quick sear directly on hot bbq grates).</li>
    <li>Remove from pan and place in heavy duty foil, wrapping tightly.  Let sit for 5-10 minutes. </li>
    <li>Slice tri tip against the grain, taking note that the grain of the meat changes direction slightly when you get to the largest, thickest portion</li>
    <li>Pour remaining butter from hot pan (be careful, the handle is hot) and also the meat juices from the foil, over the sliced meat. Notes</li>
</ol>
