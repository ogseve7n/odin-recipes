   <h3>Descripton</h3>
<p>
    <em>
        This easy sheet pan meal is a riff on my extremely popular sheet pan fajitas. Sliced chicken, vegetables, and an easy spice mix gets roasted all in the same pan for an ultra flavorful mix. I love this recipe because you can eat it a few ways! Layer it on a flatbread with hummus, feta cheese and some tzatziki, or add it to a grain bowl (we love it over white rice). It also makes great leftovers and reheats well. Sometimes if I have leftovers, I’ll add chopped kale or spinach and turn it into a salad. Either way this is a super versatile and delicious meal that you’ll love!.

<ul>
    <li>1 red, yellow, or orange bell pepper cut into 1" squares</li>
    <li>1 medium onion red or yellow, cut into 1/2″-1″ squares</li>
    <li>1 small-medium zucchini sliced into 1/3" pieces</li>
    <li>1 small-medium zucchini sliced into 1/3" pieces</li>
    <li>2 pounds boneless skinless chicken thighs about 6 thighs</li>
    <li>4 tablespoons olive oil</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
    <li>1 ½ teaspoon lemon pepper or sub 1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons dried oregano</li>
    <li>1 ½ teaspoon dried basil</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon onion powder</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon freshly minced rosemary leaves, optional</li>
    <li>1 lemon</li>
    <li>⅓ cup feta cheese</li>

</ul>
<h3>Instructions</h3>
<ol>
   <li>Preheat oven to 425 degrees.</li>
   <li>Prepare pan: If desired, line pan with foil for easy clean up. Note- I like to use an extra large sheet pan for this recipe, but you can also make it on a standard sheet pan (which is what I'm using in the photos). The more crowded your food, the more moisture in the pan so it tends to have a bit more liquid. Sometimes depending on the size of your vegetables, this can get a bit crowded on a single standard pan, but if that's what you've got, it will work great!</li>
   <li>Place cut vegetables on the prepared baking sheet. You can include your small tomatoes whole, or if you have the time, I like to cut them in half and press the seeds and pulp into the sink just to get rid of a little more liquid.</li>
   <li>Pat chicken thighs dry with paper towels. Use a clean pair of kitchen sheers to trim off any excess pieces of large fat (no need to remove ALL fat). Slice chicken into ½-inch slices and add it to the vegetables on the pan.</li>
   <li>Drizzle with 4 tablespoons olive oil. Sprinkle on the salt, lemon pepper, oregano, basil, garlic, onion, and rosemary if using.</li>
   <li>Toss to evenly distribute all oil and spices over chicken and vegetables.  *I use food-safe gloves and do this with my hands massaging everything together.</li>
   <li>Place in oven and roast for 20 minutes.  Use a spatula to toss mixture and then return to oven for an additional 15 minutes. Finally, turn on the broiler and cook (watching carefully) until vegetables are slightly browned and caramelized and chicken has an internal temperature of 165 degrees or more. </li>
   <li>Remove pan from oven and immediately toss with 1/3 cup feta cheese and a squeeze of fresh lemon juice. Add additional salt if needed. Serve in a grain bowl or in a wrap with desired condiments.</li>
